Some basic reminders on how to use the Proxmark 3.  
## Install
Proxmark 3 rdv4 [repo](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3)  
Previous proxmarks [repo](https://github.com/Proxmark/proxmark3)

### 0 - WSL2 special
If you are using WSL2 you need some extra steps to access USB devices.
The Microsoft [doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/wsl/connect-usb)

#### Windows side
On the Windows store install winget (Programme d'installation d'application)  
On (root) Powershell, update then restart your linux install, then run the following command to install "USBIPD-WIN"
```powershell
wsl --update
wsl --shutdown
winget install --interactive --exact dorssel.usbipd-win
```

Once it's done, list the usb devices
```powershell
usbipd wsl list
```

And attach it to your linux instance
```powershell
 usbipd wsl attach --busid previsously_found_usb_id
```

### 1 - Discard modemmanager
The issue is discussed [here](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3/blob/master/doc/md/Installation_Instructions/ModemManager-Must-Be-Discarded.md)
```bash
sudo apt remove modemmanager
yay -R modemmanager
```

### 2 - Install and  compile
The [wiki](https://github.com/Proxmark/proxmark3/wiki)  
Clone :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3.git
cd proxmark3
```
- Install dependancies :  

Kali
```bash
apt install git build-essential libreadline8 libreadline-dev gcc-arm-none-eabi libusb-0.1-4 libusb-dev ncurses-dev perl pkg-config libpcsclite-dev pcscd
```
Arch
```bash
yay -S gcc-arm-none-eabi
```
- Compile :
```bash
make clean && make all
```
- Flash :
```bash
./pm3-flash-all
```
- Udev :
```bash
```
## Usage
### Recon

Identifying High-Frequency (hf) and Low-Frequency (lf) tags
```bash
proxmark3>hf search
proxmark3>lf search
```

### Keys

Mifare key check
```bash
proxmark3>hf mf chk --1k -* --dump -f ext_keys.dic
```
hf : high-frequency  
mf : mifare  
chk : check keys  
--1 : mifare 1k  
-* : A and B keys  
--dump : dump keys to a file (dumpkeys.bin)  
-f ext_keys.dic : [dictionary](https://github.com/ikarus23/MifareClassicTool/blob/master/Mifare%20Classic%20Tool/app/src/main/assets/key-files/extended-std.keys)
  
ps : keep in mind that the dumpkeys.bin and dumpdata.bin will be saved in the directory from which you ran the command.
If you are in your home directory and run [path to the git clone]/proxmark3/client/proxmark3, the files will be saved in 
your home directory
         
### Nested
If all keys are not found using the previous dictionary attack, we should use the nested attack :

```bash
proxmark3>hf mf nested 1 0 A a0a1a2a3a4a5
```

hf : high-frequency  
mf : mifare  
nested : attack type   
1 : mifare 1k  
0 : block number of known key  
A : key type of known key  
a0a1a2a3a4a5 : known key  

### Data

Complete dump of the card to dumpadata.bin, using the dumpkeys.bin file  
```bash
proxmark3>hf mf dump
```

In the same directory of the proxmark client, you ll find the "pm3_mfd2eml.py" script, 
to convert the .bin into .eml
Note that this step is no longer necessary with the latest updates as the hf mf dump command dump in both .eml and .bin format and that hf mf cload accept both format as well
```bash
python pm3_mfd2eml.py dumpdata.bin random_name.eml
```

Now all you have to do is clone it on a magic card
```bash
proxmark3>hf mf cload -f random_name
```
