Some basic reminders on how to use the Proxmark 3.  

### Recon

Identifying High-Frequency (hf) and Low-Frequency (lf) tags
```bash
proxmark3>hf search
proxmark3>lf search
```

### Keys

Mifare key check
```bash
proxmark3>hf mf chk *1 ? d ext_keys.dic
```
hf : high-frequency  
mf : mifare  
chk : check keys  
*1 : mifare 1k  
? : A and B keys  
d : dump keys to a file (dumpkeys.bin)  
ext_keys.dic : [dictionary](https://github.com/ikarus23/MifareClassicTool/blob/master/Mifare%20Classic%20Tool/app/src/main/assets/key-files/extended-std.keys)
  
ps : keep in mind that the dumpkeys.bin and dumpdata.bin will be saved in the directory from which you ran the command.
If you are in your home directory and run [path to the git clone]/proxmark3/client/proxmark3, the files will be saved in 
your home directory
           
### Data

Complete dump of the card to dumpadata.bin, using the dumpkeys.bin file  
```bash
proxmark3>hf mf dump
```

In the same directory of the proxmark client, you ll find the "pm3_mfd2eml.py" script, 
to convert the .bin into .eml
```bash
python pm3_mfd2eml.py dumpdata.bin random_name.eml
```

Now all you have to do is clone it on a magic card
```bash
proxmark3>hf mf cload random_name
```
