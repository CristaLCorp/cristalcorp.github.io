Some basic reminders on how to use the Proxmark 3.  

### Recon

Identifying High-Frequency (hf) and Low-Frequency (lf) tags
```bash
proxmark3>hf search
proxmark3>lf search
```

Mifare key check
```bash
proxmark3>hf mf chk *1 ? d ext_keys.dic
```
hf : high-frequency  
mf : mifare  
chk : check keys  
*1 : all sectors  
? : A and B keys
