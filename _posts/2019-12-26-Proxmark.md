Some basic reminders on how to use the Proxmark 3.  
## Install
Proxmark 3 rdv4 [repo](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3)  
Previous proxmarks [repo](https://github.com/Proxmark/proxmark3)

### 1 - Discard modemmanager
The issue is discussed [here](https://github.com/RfidResearchGroup/proxmark3/blob/master/doc/md/Installation_Instructions/ModemManager-Must-Be-Discarded.md)
```bash
apt-remove modemmanager
yay -R modemmanager
```

### 2 - Install and  compile
The [wiki](https://github.com/Proxmark/proxmark3/wiki)  
Clone :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Proxmark/proxmark3.git
cd proxmark3
```
- Install dependancies :  

Kali
```bash
apt install git build-essential libreadline5 libreadline-dev gcc-arm-none-eabi libusb-0.1-4 libusb-dev libqt4-dev ncurses-dev perl pkg-config libpcsclite-dev pcscd
```
Arch
```bash
yay -S gcc-arm-none-eabi
```
- Compile :
```bash
make clean && make all
```
- Flash :
```bash
./pm3-flash-all
```
- Udev :
```bash
```
## Usage
### Recon

Identifying High-Frequency (hf) and Low-Frequency (lf) tags
```bash
proxmark3>hf search
proxmark3>lf search
```

### Keys

Mifare key check
```bash
proxmark3>hf mf chk *1 ? d ext_keys.dic
```
hf : high-frequency  
mf : mifare  
chk : check keys  
*1 : mifare 1k  
? : A and B keys  
d : dump keys to a file (dumpkeys.bin)  
ext_keys.dic : [dictionary](https://github.com/ikarus23/MifareClassicTool/blob/master/Mifare%20Classic%20Tool/app/src/main/assets/key-files/extended-std.keys)
  
ps : keep in mind that the dumpkeys.bin and dumpdata.bin will be saved in the directory from which you ran the command.
If you are in your home directory and run [path to the git clone]/proxmark3/client/proxmark3, the files will be saved in 
your home directory
         
### Nested
If all keys are not found using the previous dictionary attack, we should use the nested attack :

```bash
proxmark3>hf mf nested 1 0 A a0a1a2a3a4a5
```

hf : high-frequency  
mf : mifare  
nested : attack type   
1 : mifare 1k  
0 : block number of known key  
A : key type of known key  
a0a1a2a3a4a5 : known key  

### Data

Complete dump of the card to dumpadata.bin, using the dumpkeys.bin file  
```bash
proxmark3>hf mf dump
```

In the same directory of the proxmark client, you ll find the "pm3_mfd2eml.py" script, 
to convert the .bin into .eml
```bash
python pm3_mfd2eml.py dumpdata.bin random_name.eml
```

Now all you have to do is clone it on a magic card
```bash
proxmark3>hf mf cload random_name
```
