# Custom Keyboard config
I just found out through (this video)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuQVbZ0wENE] a fantastic tool to reconfigure my keyboard.  
Not only it can make useless keys like CAPS LOCK useful again but it can also help fine tuning your keyboard layout.  

  
In my case I have a Keychron K3 with a ISO UK layout and my '\|' key between left shift and 'Z' is interpreted as '<>'. I am sure there is a way to directly edit the layout or import the correct one but to be honest... I was lazy. So when I watched this video, I seized the opportunity to fix this problem as well as tweaking my CAPS LOCK key. Lets dive in.

## Kanata
The project is called (kanata)[https://github.com/jtroo/kanata] and is written in Rust, so let start by installing Rust.
```bash
sudo pacman -S rust
# or download it from here https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install by typing
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

The doc can be found (here)[https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/blob/main/docs/config.adoc]  
And (this site)[https://www.toptal.com/developers/keycode] can help you find key name/code/numer if your layout is not directly covered in the doc.

# Hyprland
Warning : Does not works with NVidia drivers at the moment.
This starter script is a really good place to start playing around with an out of the box config.

This video is more like a step-by-step "build your own config"
