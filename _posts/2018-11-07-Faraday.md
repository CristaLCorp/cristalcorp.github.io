How to (re)setup Faraday and integrate it directly in your terminal

## Prerequis


terminal post

<br>

## set up notes
as root :
systemctl restart postgresql.service
su - postgres

as postgres :
psql -l (list all db)
dropdb faraday
psql -c "DROP ROLE faraday_postgresql"

as user :
git clone farday
(git checkout dev)

as root :
install requierments (pip install .txt)
./install.sh
python2.7 manage.py initdb (pour password "faraday")
username: faraday 
password: tdnEpEVXFDLl

launch faraday as a user, then :
- url
- username to connect to the api to
- password
create your workspace

launch the web api/database (as the same user in order to preserve your workspace)
python-faraday --gui=no-gui --workspace=hack

finally from your zsh console just launch the faraday-terminal.zsh (any would work git or pre installed as it looks in your user .faraday dir)
now eerything you do should be sent to the web app :)
