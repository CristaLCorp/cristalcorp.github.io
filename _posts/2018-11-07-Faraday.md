How to (re)setup Faraday and integrate it directly in your terminal

## Prerequis

First of all, checkout the [https://cristalcorp.github.io/2018/10/14/Terminal.html](post) about how to setup your terminal with ZSH and friends.

## set up notes
as root :
{% highlight bash %}
systemctl restart postgresql.service
su - postgres
{% endhighlight %}

as postgres :
{% highlight bash %}
psql -l (list all db)
dropdb faraday
psql -c "DROP ROLE faraday_postgresql"
{% endhighlight %}

as user :
{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://github.com/infobyte/faraday.git
(git checkout dev)
{% endhighlight %}

as root :
{% highlight bash %}
install requierments (pip install .txt)
./install.sh
python2.7 manage.py initdb (pour password "faraday")
username: faraday
password: weirdgeneratedpass
{% endhighlight %}

launch faraday as a user, then :
- check the url of your Faraday Server
- username to connect to the api
- password
- create your workspace
- and then close the faraday GUI

launch the web api/database (as the same user in order to preserve your workspace)
{% highlight bash %}
python-faraday --gui=no-gui --workspace=hack
{% endhighlight %}

finally from your zsh console just launch the faraday-terminal.zsh (any would work, git or pre installed as it looks in your user .faraday dir)
now everything you do should be sent to the server and available through the WebApp :)
